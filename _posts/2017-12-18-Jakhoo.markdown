#### Preperation
---
**Difficulty**
* This is a moderately hard hike and anyone in good walking condition can do it.

**Best Season**
* This trail is open all year
* The trail has a well paved road all the way to the top.
* Most of this trail is above 2000 mts (9000 ft) mean sea level so it snows here and the snow stays. Avoid doing this in winters after fresh spell of snow.

**Which Day?**
* All days are good.

**What to take along?**
* Nothing required. Water , food and snacks are available all the way to the top. This is a tourist trail. Go carefree!
